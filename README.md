## What is this?
This is a simple implementation of Monopoly using Python

## To start the game

Please install pygame first before start the game. 
Then, run python3 main.py. Enjoy! 

To install pygame: pip install pygame

## Notes
Due to the length of a typical monopoly game, the game is set to end after 30 turns.  
Whichever player has the most assets at the end of the game is declared the winner.  
Players may also lose the game if they go bankrupt.  

You can click on the demos button of the main menu screen to load specific scenarios.  
If you want to avoid playing the full game, and simply see the win condition, there is a scenario called end game that 
you may find useful.
